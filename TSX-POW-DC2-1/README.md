# Product Details 
TSX-POW-DC2-x is a power supply unit in SX form of Tony Space platform. Using TIâ€™s switching voltage regulator TPS54331, the board can deliver 5V 3A from wide range voltage input. This is sufficient for most applications including applications that use 3G/4G GSM modules.

In addition, 2 power relays are provided with the board for general purpose. These replays are controlled by digital output pins from the MCU board with the following method.
- Relay1 controlled by IO14
       - Logic High - COM is connected to NC
       - Logic Low - COM is connected to NO
- Relay1 controlled by IO15
       - Logic High - COM is connected to NC
       - Logic Low - COM is connected to NO
