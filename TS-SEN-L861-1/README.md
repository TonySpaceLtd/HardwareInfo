# Product Details
TS-SEN-L861-1 is a GNSS sensor module for Tony Space platform. Despite L86's built-in Patch-On-Top (POT) antenna, an external can also be used through the U.FL connector for better performance. L86 supports automatic antenna switching function. It can achieve the switching between internal patch antenna and external active antenna. Moreover, it keeps positioning during the switching process.

Combining advanced AGPS called EASY™ (Embedded Assist System) and proven AlwaysLocate™ technology, L86 achieves the highest performance and fully meets the industrial standard. EASY™ technology allows L86 to calculate and predict orbits automatically using the ephemeris data (up to 3 days) stored in internal RAM memory, so L86 can fix position quickly even at indoor signal levels with low power consumption. With AlwaysLocate™ technology, L86 can adaptively adjust the on/off time to achieve balance between positioning accuracy and power consumption according to the environmental and motion conditions.
