# Product Details
TS-COM-BC95G1-1 is the BC95-G module for Tony Space platform. Mainly used for NB-IoT communication, the board is composed of BC95-G and a low-quiescent-current software-controlled power switch. The power switch limits the current consumed to maximum of 1uA in shut down mode. Both plastic nano SIM socket and MFF2 eSIM footprint are provided, so eSIM can be installed later in case of use. A LTE/4G embedded antenna is supplied with the product for use with on-board U.FL/IPEX connector. 

For more information, BC95-G is a Quectelâ€™s communication module for Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN). Which is a WAN network designed to allow long-range communications at a low bit rate among things (connected objects). The module supports 4G LTE standard, NB-IoT (NarrowBand Internet of Things / LTE Cat. NB1 and NB2) with B1/B3/B5/B8/B20/B28 bands. Controlled by AT Command via serial UART, it is suited for IoT applications that require low power consumption. The protocols supported are TCP / UDP / MQTT with the downlink speed up to 25.2 kbps and uplink speed up to 54 kbps (Multi Tone).
