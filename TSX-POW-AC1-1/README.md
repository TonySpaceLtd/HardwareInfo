# Product Details
TSX-POW-AC1-x is a power supply unit in SX form of Tony Space platform. Using Hi-Linkâ€™s power module HLK-5M05, the board can deliver 5V 1A from 90-240 VAC. This is sufficient for most applications.

In addition, 2 power relays are provided with the board for general purpose. These replays are controlled by digital output pins from the MCU board with the following method.
- Relay1 controlled by IO14,
  - Logic High - COM is connected to NC 
  - Logic Low - COM is connected to NO
- Relay1 controlled by IO15
  - Logic High - COM is connected to NC 
  - Logic Low - COM is connected to NO
